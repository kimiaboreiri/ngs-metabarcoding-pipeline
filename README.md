# Metabarcoding Analysis Pipeline

This repository presents a metabarcoding and eDNA bioinformatics workflow for biodiversity assessment using next-generation sequencing (NGS) data.

##  Project Overview
Metabarcoding uses marker-gene sequencing to detect species from environmental DNA (eDNA).  
This pipeline reflects real-world metabarcoding analysis used in research and biodiversity monitoring.

##  Workflow
- Quality control of FASTQ files  
- Adapter and primer trimming  
- ASV generation  
- Taxonomic assignment  
- Diversity analysis  

##  Tools
- QIIME2  
- DADA2  
- Cutadapt
- Python
- R for visualization  

##  Applications
- Biodiversity monitoring  
- Environmental DNA studies  
- Ecological research
